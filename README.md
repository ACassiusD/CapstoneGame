# CapstoneGame
A game called Sora, created by Alex Donnelly and Daniel Munusami as a group effort for final year capstone project. Sora was voted the best programming project at the Durham College IT Expo/Tradeshow. Created in Gamemaker Studio written in GML.

Sora is a fast paced precise platformer that will challenge you with its unforgiving but fair gameplay. 

A variety of movement options allows a great amount of control of your character.
